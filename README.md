# CEE-piler
After spending most of my time in the world of high-level, abstracted programming languages, I found myself wondering: what is actually happening under the bonnet?

I realised I didn't truly understand low-level computing concepts or systems architecture. To bridge this gap, I decided to dive into the deep end. This project is my attempt to build a C Compiler from scratch.

The catch? I have never written a line of C before. This repository documents my journey, my mistakes, and my attempt to answer the question: How hard could it really be?
