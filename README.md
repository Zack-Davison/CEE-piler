Since developing my programming skills, I have recently been wondering how programming languages and computers work at a lower level. Up until
now I have only worked using programming languages that are highly abstracted therefore I have never really needed to understand low level
computing concepts.

Therefore to learn low level programming and system's development I am going to create a C compiler, keep in mind I have never worked with C 
before. How hard could it really be..
